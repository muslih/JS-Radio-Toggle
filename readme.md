#JS Radio Toggle
A very simple jquery plugin to make a toggle content using radio button

#How To Use?

##Include jQuery and JsRadioToggle

To use JsRadioToggle, you’ll need to make sure both the JsRadioToggle and jQuery scripts are included. If you’ve already got jQuery (you can test by opening your JavaScript console and typing !!window.jQuery — if it says true, you have jQuery), you don’t need to add the first line.

```
<script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js"></script>
<script src="http://muslih/github/jsradiotoggle.js"></script>

```
